# eloladder

This was a project to make an ELO-ranking based ladder.

You can create multiple leagues, invite players, and record match results. There are some pretty graphs.

It has minimal features, but I'm releasing it into the wild "as-is" as inspiration/a template for others who wish to do the same.

Updates and support will be minimal, but you're free to fork it and experiment.

PRs are always welcome.
